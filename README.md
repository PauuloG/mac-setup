# Mac setup Cheatsheet ✌️

That new Mac won't set itself up bitch.

The first thing you can do is download this repo as a ZIP, in order to be able to run the tender script without first having to setup your SSH keys or install git.

You should have a backup of your ssh keys and config files stored somewhere, you can restore it independently of the rest.

Generally speaking, you will need to install google chrome and Dashlane to even access this page without breaking a sweat ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, no easy way around that really
